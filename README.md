##Google Search - Link Copy - 0.0.1
A tiny extension for `Google Chrome` to make copying links from google pain free.
Generally when you right click a link on google search and select
`Copy Link Address`, the url copied is google's redirecting url and not the original url.

So I introduced an extra option in the contextmenu for google search links, `Copy real link`, using this you can copy the original link without any alteration.

To install, download the zip provided by github. Extract it to a folder. Open `chrome://extensions`. Select `Developer Mode` option. 
Click on `Load unpacked extension` button and choose the path to which you have extracted. Now open new google search page and start using it.

I will put up a link for the `.crx` when I find the time. I have just put the copy for the query results. Don't expect it to work for normal links on google search. Just use the `Copy Link Address` provided by chrome to do that.

###Features planned
Copy text of url (heading of results)
Copy urls in facebook as facebook also puts a redirection wall for the links in chat and posts
