##Google Search  and Facebook Chat- Link Copy - 0.0.1
I was fed up of the redirection urls google gives on its search results - making it a chore to copy the link address.
So I went ahead and created this project overnight.

A tiny extension for `Google Chrome` to make copying links from google pain free.
Generally when you right click a link on google search and select
`Copy Link Address`, the url copied is google's redirecting url and not the original url.
It looks like this `https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCMQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLed_Zeppelin&ei=DFHnU8_mK4Hi8AXqpIDAAg&usg=AFQjCNHIjSJNblTZM7fbhcTkrPNp14SnKw&sig2=L95WqCRVToubyMsGNnBFWg&bvm=bv.72676100,d.dGc`

So I introduced an extra option in the contextmenu for google search links, `Copy real link`, using this you can copy the original link without any alteration.

Using this extension, the copied link is this
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin`

Now working for Facebook too.
When you copy a link in `facebook` chat, you get it like this `http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arsenal.com%2Fhome&h=iAQF4eyqM`, using this extension the copied url will be `http://www.arsenal.com/home`.

Putting this on chromestore might take some time.<br />
