##Google Search - Link Copy - 0.0.1
A tiny extension for `Google Chrome` to make copying links from google pain free.
Generally when you right click a link on google search and select
`Copy Link Address`, the url copied is google's redirecting url and not the original url.

So I introduced an extra option in the contextmenu for google search links, `Copy real link`, using this you can copy the original link without any alteration.
